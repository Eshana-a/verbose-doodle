Application where a user can enjoy the benefits of all types of subscriptions without having to pay for each. 

Each subscription is a ticket of a service.

Main functions: 
 1) Exchanging subscriptions: 
  - You can put up your own account for a certain amount of days (put up a ticket) and in return temporarily rent another ticket.
  
 2) Earn by putting your ticket up for grabs. 
 
 3) If the user doesn't have a ticket of their own then they can buy the ticket for relatively less amount.
